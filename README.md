# News-Hunter

Sentimental Analysis of news and tweets via chatbot. 
This project brings to users a whole new interactive way of staying updated on the go.
Here we have implemented a chatbot using AIML through which the services are interfaced.
When the user asks for news or public opinion in twitter corressponding php scripts are 
triggered. 
We have implemented php script to fetch headlines from reliable sources like google news
and a python script to fetch tweets from twitter and also perform sentimental analysis on it
to get public opinion.
The user entries are logged into a database, on which machine learning  may be applied
to make recommendations and enhanced customized service to the user.
